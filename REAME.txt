The code make_koch_snowflake generates instances of Koch's snowflake curve.

Compilation: 
Any standard C compiler will do. E.g.: 
    gcc -O2 -Wall -o make_koch_snowflake make_koch_snowflake.c -lm

Usage:
    make_koch_snowflake --number N --output XYZ [--nested]
       where N is a positive integer.

Generating polygonal data: 

The runtime-option "--number N" specifies the order of the snowflake curve.
For N=1 we simply get a triangle. The curve is written to the file named XYZ,
as specified in "--output XYZ". If the option "--nested" is given then the
code generates two copies of the snowflake curve, where the smaller copy forms
a hole inside the larger copy. E.g., for N=1 we get a triangle inside of a
triangle.
